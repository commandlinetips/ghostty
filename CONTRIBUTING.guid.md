  Next Steps for Your Arabic Support Contribution

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Don't Open a Pull Request Yet!

  According to Ghostty's contribution guidelines:

  "Pull requests should be associated with a previously
  accepted issue."

  What You Should Do:

  1. Open a Discussion First (not a pull request):
    - Go to: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussi
  ons/new?category=feature-requests-ideas
    - Title: "Arabic/RTL Text Support with BiDi Rendering"
    - Link to your fork:
  https://github.com/commandlinetips/ghostty
    - Explain the feature and show that it's already
  implemented and tested
  2. In Your Discussion, Include:
    - What the feature does (Arabic/Hebrew BiDi support)
    - Why it's useful (RTL language support)
    - That it's already implemented with all tests passing
    - Link to your fork showing the working code
    - Screenshots/demos if possible
  3. AI Disclosure Required:
  According to lines 16-53, you MUST disclose AI assistance.
   Add this to your discussion:

  AI Assistance Disclosure:
  This feature was implemented with assistance from Claude
  Code. The implementation was reviewed and tested by me,
  and I understand the code and can answer questions about
  it.
  4. Wait for Acceptance:
    - Maintainers will review your discussion
    - They may create an issue if they accept the feature
    - Only then should you open a pull request

  Why This Process?

  From the guide:
  - Issues are for actionable items only
  - Discussions are for feature requests and ideas
  - PRs without prior discussion "may be closed or remain
  stale"
  - This prevents wasted effort on features that won't be
  accepted

  Alternative: Check Existing Issues

  Search for existing Arabic/RTL issues:
  - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues?q=arabic
  - https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues?q=rtl
  - If one exists and is accepted, you can open a PR
  directly!

  Don't rush into a PR - follow their process and you'll
  have a much better chance of acceptance! 🎯
